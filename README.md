## Space-X

### Introduction :
  The Space-X application is used to help users list and browse all the launches by SpaceX program. It uses multiple filter parameters like the Launch Year, whether or not the launch was successfull and/or had a successfull landing, in order to make the search easier for the users.
  
### Technologies :
* React 16.13.1
* Redux 4.0.5

### Approach :
* The project uses Redux, React-Redux for state management. While component specific state is maintained in the component, application specific data has been maintained using Redux.
* The project uses 'axios' to make API calls.
* The UI components have been styled using CSS
* The application's UI is responsive. Media Queries have been used to ensure that the content rendering adapts to different screen sizes.
